Businesses must stay up-to-date with regulatory standards, especially with new guidelines focused on mental health, chronic diseases, and workplace ergonomics. Additionally, digital solutions will become more prevalent in reducing overhead costs and increasing the efficiency of the medical screening process.</p><p>In conclusion, the pre-employment medical examination market is expected to experience dynamic changes in the coming years.
